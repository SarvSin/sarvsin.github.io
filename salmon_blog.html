									<h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>Harmful algal blooms are increasing universally with respect to frequency, magnitude, and duration, and are driven largely by anthropogenic actions. They occur in aquaculture regions globally; exhaustive and poorly managed crustacean and finfish strategies can contribute to the creation of harmful algal blooms. These blooms are often the result of ineffective monitoring, and management in parts of the industry. This is especially the case in developing countries like Chile, where large blooms in 2016 caused salmon mortalities of 40,000 tonnes and caused operations to close for 2 years because of food safety risks. This generated massive economic losses that were magnified due to the size of the salmon industry in the export economy. To prevent a vicious cycle, and to build a sustainable aquaculture industry in Chile, it is crucial to understand the vulnerabilities, and predict harmful algal blooms in the area. </p>
                  <h3>Analysis</h3>
                  <p>The aquaculture industry has registered a noteworthy growth in the past 60 years with the world population increase, and healthier diet demand. The Chilean aquaculture industry has ensued similar exponential growth since the 1990s. In 2019, Chile had more than 2000 aquaculture centres dedicated chiefly to the farming of introduced species such as salmonids, representing approximately 78% of the national production.  The salmon industry has become one of Chile’s main export sectors and a major contributor to national development. As of 2022, Chile is the second largest salmon producer in the world after Norway. 
                  </p>
                            Figure 1: World salmon production
                                   
                                       Figure 2: Chilean salmon production

This trend however was interrupted in years 2009 and 2016, as figure 2 demonstrates. The coastal waters of Southern Chile, specifically in the Los Lagos, or region X in the south zone of Chile, were subjugated to a series of huge harmful algal blooms (HABs) around both these periods. The blooms effectuated in massive losses of wild and cultured fish, as well as expansive Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) toxin adulteration. Tonnes of salmon were killed over a widespread area, and in the 2016 event, this mortality reached 39 million salmon. Reflecting a harvest weight of 100,000 metric tons, this caused losses of US $800 million.

                                            
Harmful algal bloom events

HAB events are increasingly causing serious harm to economic sectors related to the exploitation of coastal resources in Chile. The salmon farming industry in Chile is mainly located in the regions of Los Lagos (region X), Aysen, and Magallanes. The feasibility of cultured fish is endangered by HABs through the following mechanisms – respiratory disorders due to damage to the gills caused by microalgae, or due to oxygen loss following bacterial degradation, or due to the toxicity of dinoflagellates. In figure 5, all HAB events characterised by a cell density greater than 1x10^6 L^-1  of toxic dinoflagellates or diatoms since the year 1980 have been plotted. As is demonstrated, most devastating algal blooms have been concentrated in southern Chile, specifically in region X, the epicentre of salmon farming.
                  
                                    Figure 3: Diatoms in Los Lagos, Chile
                       
                                    Figure 4: HAB recurring species

Additionally, figure 4 shows the analysis of data on the scientific categorisation of dominant toxins present during these harmful algal bloom events. Dinoflagellates A. catenella and D. acuta, and the diatoms P.australis and C. verruculosa are the most frequently associated with large HAB events in southern Chile. All these species of phytoplankton are known for causing red tides, and catalysing paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) outbreaks. Although water temperature effects due to El Nino are the most obvious triggering factors for the major HAB events, higher temperatures alone are insufficient to create HAB events. Figure 3 for diatom cell density found in region X gives support to this pattern. 

   
Figure 5 : a) HAB events in Chile since 1980, b) Nitrates in Los Lagos region in 2016 HAB crisis

Sharp peaks in 2002-2009 coincide with El Nino years, but the peaks in year 2016, the strongest El nino year, and in 2018-2019, are significantly lower. Clearly there are other influencing factors for harmful algal blooms in the region. Additionally, the fact that A. catenella’s multiplication is stimulated by higher ammonia and inorganic nitrogen concentrations indicates that anthropogenic pollution might be of interest.

Anthropogenic pollution

Heightened vertical interfusing of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous can greatly increase not only the likelihood of an algal bloom, but also affect a species-specific response to such biological alterations. It is generally acknowledged that the overall effect of nutrient over-enrichment on harmful algal species is species-specific. Growth of some dinoflagellates like A. catenella is directly affected by the quantity of nitrates dissolved in water. Additionally, when human sources of nutrients are added, an overabundance of phytoplankton, underwater oxygen depletion, and consequent eutrophication can happen. Ammonia discharges from farm irrigation are likely significant and widely dispensed in Reloncavi Sound and Fjord. Remains of uneaten food, and excretion of confined fish confined are the dominant roots of this discharge. Figures 6 and 9 indicate a sharply rising trend in nitrates and phosphates in the Los Lagos region until 2009-2010, when the levels of both nutrients stabilised at the peak.


                    
                              Figure 6: Nitrates in Los Lagos time series (1992-2021)

The magnitude of dispersion in nutrient level has increased over the years, suggesting a multiplicative seasonality influence. Besides nutrients, ocean acidity is also a factor that can trigger a phytoplankton species-specific response. The effects of ocean acidification on the growth of many HAB species has been well-studied with complex intra- and inter-species-specific responses reported (Raven et al., 2019). Finally, toxin production by multiple harmful algae amplifies under high pCO2 conditions including, saxitoxins produced by Alexandrium spp. (Tatters et al., 2013; HattenrathLehmann et al., 2015a, 2015b). To analyse the acidity of, and presence of spCO2, time series graphs were plotted. Fig. 10, 11 illuminate the worrying trend in the pH and carbon dioxide levels in the Chilean fjords. This gives weight to more frequent, and potent red tide and harmful algal bloom events in the future. 



Discussion

Salmon farming in Chile

The Fisheries Development Institute (IFOP) of Chile first introduced salmon fish to Chile. To cultivate, and adjust technologies to establish a salmon fish industry, the Government engaged in knowledge transfer programs with establishments across the country and internationally.
          
                    Figure 7: Chlorophyll in Los Lagos time series (1992 – 2021)

The private sector in Chile developed rapidly following innovation in areas like fishery administration and management of cold chain. In addition, low barriers to entry and increasing export demand invigorated private sector interest. In 1989, Chile grossed around $500 million from its salmon exports. By 1999, market needs acted as the main contributors of the Chilean aquaculture industry’s growth. Particularly, a departure of smaller companies due to a fall in salmon prices on the global scale during the 1990s sped up industrial unification. International investors were drawn to, and looked to capitalise on this phenomenon, hence further invested in fresh sites for production in the area. 

As is shown in figure 8, a drop in capture fish yield also generated the growth of salmon aquaculture in Chile. Overfishing due to a sharp rise in demand for fish by populations in developed countries, who were becoming increasingly conscious of their health, was the main cause of the fall in wild or capture fishing. Chile transformed into an international supplier of salmon when in 1998 it’s proportion of global produce increased to 22%. Tensions developed between an increased appetite for short-term financial gains, long-term plans, and a regulatory infrastructure to balance it. The Government demonstrated little engagement in advancing and administering harsher regulations to build an environment for sustainable growth, especially considering the great volume of capital flow into Chile. Expectedly, the aggressive progress was brought to an abrupt halt when in 2007, an exceedingly infectious disease called ISA (Infectious Salmon Anaemia) wrecked salmon production. 

In the background of immense environmental, financial, and social consequences, much attention was drawn to the adverse impacts of the industry. The spread of the virus was found to have been fuelled by the insanitary, crammed cages which held up to 500,000 fish in a small geographical region. 



                       
                    Figure 8: Production source of Chilean Fish Production (1980 – 2020)

The worst was yet to come, unfortunately. In 2009, besides the delayed consequences from the 2007 aquatic epidemic, a historically intense Alexandrium catenella event occurred in the spring. In the Los Lagos region, dinoflagellate concentrations of more than 6000 cells per ml were recorded. From 386,000 tonnes in 2006, Atlantic salmon harvest fell to 123,000 tonnes in 2011. A loss of $2 billion dollars was occurred by the industry, and jobs of more than 20,000 direct and indirect workers in the aquaculture industry were lost. To fund improvement in sanitary and ecological investments on behalf of a proportion of industry, the Chilean government provided bank loan guarantees for almost 60% of the cases. Following this, the General Law on Fisheries and Aquaculture was modified, and multiple new regulations were enforced. However, history repeated itself in 2016, when a large toxic bloom caused the death of nearly 25 million salmon, and in 2018, when a Marine Harvest ASA suffered losses of more than 900,000 farmed salmon.

In both cases, the Chilean Superintendency of the Environment either blamed the natural phenomenon of El Nino to explain the entire algal bloom event, or acknowledged poor quality standards of the firm, yet took no action. In the Marine Harvest case, the SMA claimed after an investigation that the sea cages “do not keep the appropriate safety conditions or elements of optimal quality”. The salmon aquaculture development in Chile requires that government institutions act proactively to regulate and specially to enforce authority to avoid similar crises or to mitigate the social and environmental consequences. 

Harmful algal bloom events

Toxic blooms or red tides are pointers of the degree of coastal pollution forasmuch as they are environmental health signal. Over the years, there has been a shift in the characteristics of harmful algal blooms, associated with a change in Silicate and Nitrogen to Phosphorous ratios, from the usually harmless diatom blooms to highly toxic dinoflagellate blooms. This is partly because of anthropogenic pollution and nutrification of coasts. Indeed, a consensus has been reached despite much debate on the exacerbating influence of human activities on the intensity of HAGs. Most of the toxic phytoplankton species belong to the flagellate class; although there is no exhaustive list of causative species, their number is incessantly growing.

           
                        Figure 9: Phosphates in Los Lagos time series (1992 - 2021)

In common among all the toxic algae, however, is their property of altering the role of ion channels over membranes. Dividing the population of toxins into three types based on this, there are the activators, chokers, and stabilisers. Specifically in Chile over the past few decades, activator toxins that cause neurotoxic shellfish poisoning have accelerated. These toxins in aerosol cast can engender respiratory aggravation in humans, and are powerful fish killers. A mind form of poisoning can be caused by such toxins, which share their chemical structure with ciguatoxins in humans ingesting contaminated shellfish. 

Another increasingly occurring dinoflagellate in the Los Lagos region includes the Dinophysis acuta, which discharges poisons that cause Diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP) in humans. Symptoms are gastrointestinal upon humans consuming adulterated shellfish, though not fatal. The most numerous is the dinoflagellate toxin producer called Alexandrium catenella, or A. catenella which releases paralytic shellfish poisons. Accumulating mainly in filter-feeding bilvalves which are not fatally affected by them, these saxitoxins pass along the foodchain. The consumers at the end of the foodchain include more gastropods, and humans who can sometimes get fatally poisoned from paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). Grounding in fact, humans have in the past contracted PSP by consuming planktivorous fish. The symptoms in humans of this poisoning include neurological, gastrointestinal, and respiratory ailments. Harmful algal species can also cause aquatic mortality via oxygen depletion when blooms collapse, damage to gills, or gill clogging. In Chile’s recent past, attacks by dinoflagellate Gyrodinium aureoleum have caused the death of thousands of rainbow trouts due to degeneration of gill tissue. Occurring on a large scale, these blooms can cause wide-ranging losses. The economic impact extends beyond the loss of aquatic (and human) lives to the associated loss of income by fishers and farmers, the loss of consumer confidence, lowered price of suspect seafood, loss of tourism and the associated seafood restaurant earnings. Almost every report pertaining to management of toxic blooms requires constant, expensive monitoring of planktons. The Government in developing nations has not been giving much attention to zoning as an instrument of setting sites aside for aquaculture where nutrient pollution can be kept low and red tide occurrence unlikely. Coastal engineering works should also be given consideration. For instance, financial and public health incentives to shift a river mouth or to transform the shape of a bay may become correspondent to enormous dam constructions. Imaginative thinking on long-term, large-scale solutions is lacking. 



Anthropogenic pollution

The effects of pisciculture waste on the coastal marine system has been the focus of much research in recent years. Through the release of soluble dissolved nutrients and organic waste, this waste from marine salmonid farms can bring about a dramatic enrichment of the marine ecological complex, quantifying which has been attempted multiple times. Firstly, organic enrichment from wood pulp and domestic sewage sludge prompts similar changes as settlings of organic waste released from fish farms. This accumulation increases microbial operation, causing an increase in oxygen claim by the sediment ecosystem. 

 
                              Figure 10: pH in Los Lagos time series (1992 – 2021)

This increased demand has been measured in the surroundings of marine ponds to lie between 42 and 60 mmol per m2 per day by Blackburn et al. resembling rates have been gauged in sediments underneath salmon cages in Norway. Depletion of oxygen in the layer of water over sediment can result from increased ingestion of oxygen in the sediment. Indeed, expansive deoxygenation of bottom layers is probably to take place in low energy marine ecosystems. This is especially so in those embayments where water at the bottom remains trapped over many months. In such an environment, augmentation of anthropogenic nutrients can cause hyper-nutrification, which in turn could result in eutrophication. An increase in phytoplankton production is most probably the first sign of eutrophication. In addition, subtle changes in the range of phytoplankton species may also become apparent. For instance, growth of dinoflagellates may outstrip growth of diatoms as silicate availability gets affected adversely. Undesirable consequences can follow from an increase in phytoplankton productivity. Clearly in the case of Chile, hypernutrification is linked to increase in the frequency of algal blooms, and an increase in the occurrence of toxin-producing species. Some government and NGO groups have been increasingly concerned about the expansion of the salmonid industry in the oligotrophic Chilean lakes even as the scientific evidence collects on the substantial generation of dissolved nutrients due to intensive cage culture of salmon.

           
                       Figure 11: Surface CO2 in Los Lagos time series (1992 – 2021)

 Nutrient enhancement of embayment can transpire, as many researchers concede, upon observing high concentration of ammonia in the environment of cage farms. Such sites have restricted possibility for large-scale, sustainable development of aquaculture relative to clearer coastal waters, where the likelihood of waste accumulation is low. To ensure that appropriate sites are selected, and that ‘overloading’ of sheltered areas with nutrient waste does not happen, simple guidelines should be formed along with technical improvements in the construction and optimisation of cage designs. In fact, poor procedural planning to ensure an equitable resource allocation has caused much conflict among aquaculture manufacturers and consumers of marine resources. Norwegian LENKA, and Canadian coastal inventory scheme should be models of integrated coastal zone management processes for developing countries like Chile. To license fish farms, strict regulatory measures are needed which should constrain the number and size of farms, and their locations. Finally, statistically significant results for a global increase of harmful algal events are lacking despite unambiguous evidence that hyper eutrophication of marine water increases primary production of phytoplankton. The risk assessment, evaluation of potential negative influences, and the feasibility of monitoring schemes are all fettered by the near impossible task of predicting such blooms.

Conclusion
Clearly, the 2007-2008 crisis transformed the system of salmon pisciculture, and the framework of regulations in Chile. However, as suggested above, there remains potential for more improvements. From a viewpoint of assessing research activity, status reveals silos in environmental research and policy. The lack of coordination and integration among research centres and academicians, and the limited monitoring and observation systems of the Chilean marine systems are glaring blind spots. To improve understanding, accuracy of modelling, and further inform policy and regulation – availability of viable data and interoperability in environmental research activities is crucial. 
For coastal aquaculture, farm sites should be chosen where harmful algal events are rare or absent. The possibility of relocating cage farms away from affected areas should also be considered. Routine microscopic analysis of water samples for identifying harmful species in addition to gross measurements of water transparency or phytoplankton density should be included in farm management strategies. Such monitoring need not be elaborate, or expensive. When combined with actions designed to minimise losses in the presence of harmful algal events, it can be very cost-effective.
