										<h1>Attitude Formation - Machine Learning in Sociology</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/katie-moum-7XGtYefMXiQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<h2 align="center"  id="data">Data</h2>
									<p>Data analysed for this report was obtained from the latest round of The European Social
										Survey. The ESS is a unique value-based, inter-national survey designed to facilitate an
										understanding of attitudes and behaviour in the European region. It was awarded the
										European Research Infrastructure Consortium status in 2013, and the data used in this
										analysis was collected in 2018. The survey is conducted biennially, completely via face-toface interviewing. Strict guidelines for sampling, data collection, questionnaire design, and
										translation have ensured that data is comparable across participating countries and is of a
										high-quality. Data for 2020-2021 survey have not been released yet.</p>
									<p>The data was weighted to attribute unequal sample selection probabilities within each country
										as specified by design, non-response, and sampling errors related to the post-stratification
										variables, and has accounted for the differences in population size across countries.
										The dataset contains 49519 observations across 572 variables. Attention needed to be
										restricted to a subset of variables suitable for the analysis. To keep the analysis
										straightforward, one variable each was chosen for the response, and its predictors. Insights
										gained from major immigration studies allowed a scientific assignment of variables to
										measure the strength and valence of the response variable “attitude”, and the predictor
										variables - affective, cognitive, and behavioural information.</p>
									<p>The types of variables being
										studied are ordered, categorical
										variables. Such variables are
										measured on an ordinal scale,
										where although an ordering exists,
										distances between scale positions
										are not equal. This renders their
										treatment as discrete quantitative
										variables meaningless. Hence,
										methods of ordered logistic
										regression needed to be applied to
										analyse the data. Major treatments
										made to this data include reverse-scoring the measure for affective information since it was
										formulated negatively, and re-coding all responses of the kind “Refusal”, “Don’t know”, and
										“No answer” as missing, or NA. </p>
									<span class="image right"><img width="620" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 22 09" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200198840-6bb38111-f91c-486e-9ee7-6d9a6df0d476.png"></span>
									<p>In addition, catering to the objective of analysis,
										observations from immigrants and members of ethnic minorities were excluded. This was
										done to ensure a representative
										reflection of native attitudes
										towards non-native immigrants and
										members of the population.</p>
									<p>After this step, relative size of
										missing data in relation to complete
										data was computed, and the
										mechanisms of missing data were
										explored meticulously. For each
										variable of interest, responses recoded as missing were found to
										constitute less than 5% of the total
										data. Details regarding
										determination of missing data mechanism are given in the results section. A random imputed
										dataset was ultimately used, the decision supported by following findings - limited amount of
										missing data, judgement of the missing data to be of type MCAR (details in results section),
										large size of the “complete” dataset (&gt;30000), and unsignificant improvements brought by a
										MICE-imputed dataset to modelling (details in results section).
										For conducting a spatial analysis of attitudes across Europe, a dataset containing geographical
										coordinates was obtained from Statista. This was then merged with the main dataset and
										plotted. Doing so required specifying and extracting columns of interest, re-naming them, and
										merging to form a new data frame.</p>
									<span class="image right"><img width="590" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 22 35" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200198871-62746ac0-cdb1-4228-b9be-3bc0246795d9.png"></span>
									<h2 align="center" id="results">Results</h2>
									<p>To begin with, it was decided that
										responses of the kind “Refusal”,
										“Don’t know”, and “No answer” will
										be regarded as missing data. After
										labelling all such responses as “NA”, it
										remained to be assessed whether the
										missing data was to be categorised as
										MCAR, MAR, or MNAR. To visually
										analyse the missing data, a package
										called VIM was installed. If the data
										was found to be MCAR, it could be
										removed without creating bias in estimates obtained from analyses. However, if the data was
										MAR, it would need to be imputed. In addition to the mechanism, the proportion of missing
										data was considered as well. Firstly, margin plots were created to judge if the missing data
										was MAR or MCAR.</p>
									<span class="image left"><img width="596" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 22 55" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200198857-45e9d80b-c163-4e56-b302-3ff0b933d49c.png"></span>
									<p>As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, the red and blue box plots on each of the horizontal and
										vertical axes were found to be exactly same, or similar for all combinations of the predictor
										variables – the affective, cognitive, and behavioural information. This indicated that the
										Figure 2: Affective VS cognitive missing data (scale: least to most negative)
										 Figure 3: Spine plot for behavioural information (x scale: least to most negative)
										4
										missing values in one were not related to missing values in another variable. Hence, the MAR
										assumption that missingness in one variable can be explained by missingness in another, was
										violated. Secondly, spine plots were created to study the percentage of missing values within
										each category against the response variable “attitude”. Please refer to Figures 3 and 4.</p>
									<p>The width of bars reflects relative
										frequency of observations in each
										level within a category. Spine plots for
										affective, cognitive, and behavioural
										information all indicated that the
										missing data is not distributed
										according to a strong trend. In
										addition, the proportion of missing
										data in each category was found to be
										limited. This supported a conclusion
										that the missing data is MCAR, and of
										a negligible size. To confirm, a MICE
										imputation using the method “logit”
										was carried out on the categorical data. Following this, a simple logistic regression was
										carried out using pooled imputed data. </p>
									<span class="image left"><img width="596" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 22 55" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200198914-0f4fa277-d4ba-40dc-87eb-7a74ef4f84fd.png"></span>
									<p>On the other hand, a complete dataset that was
										obtained post list-wise deletion. A comparison of the coefficients only revealed
										insignificantly small changes to size of standard errors for coefficients. Hence, the remaining
										analysis was conducted on a randomly chosen MICE-imputed dataset.
										As part of the initial examination of data, explanatory and response variables were identified
										and summarised in a numerical summary. The number of levels in response variable
										“attitude” range from 1 to 4, coded as going from least to most negative. Explanatory variable
										“Affective information” ranges from 0 to 10, “behavioural information” ranges from 1 to 6,
										and “cognitive information” ranges from 0 to 10, all coded in order from least negative to
										most negative. Figure 5 shows that there exists a linear relationship between attitudes towards
										immigration and affective information, i.e., positive feelings correspond with positive
										attitudes towards immigration, and negative feelings with negative attitudes. There exists a
										weaker linear correspondence with cognitive and behavioural information and attitudes
										towards immigration. See Figure 6. It should also be noted that this relationship need not be
										causal.</p>
									<p align="center"><img width="1074" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 23 44" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200198939-5e268502-c8ee-4e08-936a-73df445477d7.png"></p>

									<p>Next, research was conducted to find packages and libraries available for performing ordered
										logistic regressions. A package called MASS was required, and the function “polr” was
										utilised to execute a cumulative, proportional-odds logistic regression. Firstly, three simple
										models with “attitude” as the response variable and “affective information”, “cognitive
										information”, and “behavioural information” as the explanatory variables were fit and
										plotted. The relationships between the levels within each explanatory variable, and the levels
										within the response variable was analysed. The plots in Figures 7-9 illustrate the discussion
										that follows. In the plots, predicted probabilities for each level were obtained from the logordered ratios, and fitted against a scale of non-cumulative probabilities.
										Figure 7 indicated
										that lower values,
										or more positive
										feelings suggested
										high probability
										for possessing a
										positive attitude
										towards
										immigration, or a
										lower level in
										“attitude”. </p>
									<p align="center"><img width="829" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 06 16" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200198997-92480207-0e49-4f03-94a4-78acfe0fc921.png"></p>
									<p>This
										relationship was
										observed to be
										same, but weaker
										for cognitive and
										behavioural
										information. In
										Figures 8 and 9 it
										was noticed that
										ambiguous attitudes coded by
										levels 2 and 3 were influenced similarly by cognitive and behavioural information ranging
										from most positive to most negative. This suggested a cognitive dissonance in the
										respondents.</p>
									<p>Because the linear relationship
										appeared to be most significant
										between affective information and
										attitudes, the simple logistic model
										with “attitude” and “affective
										information” as the response
										variable, and explanatory variables
										respectively, was chosen to be the
										base model. Against this, the
										significance of cognitive
										information was compared, against
										which the significance of a complete
										model consisting of all three
										attitude-influencers was compared
										using a log-likelihood test.</p>
									<p align="center"><img width="672" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 24 48" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200199013-47922c3e-303b-4b70-b328-93b3677ecd43.png"></p>
									<p align="center"><img width="771" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 25 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200199016-59c8d675-0a87-4921-9082-9eda3e55787e.png">
									</p>
									<p>Differences in deviance, calculated as -2 * Log-likelihood, are distributed according to the
										chi-squared distribution, which enabled an easy comparison of model fit. It made sense to
										also compare models against their AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) values as they are
										modelled on the same data. In addition, although hypothesis tests cannot be conducted on
										AIC values, these values penalise models for higher number of parameters which is useful
										especially in assessing fit of complex interaction models. As illustrated in the table in Figure
										10, the null hypothesis of no improvement was rejected after finding that the fit that included
										all components of attitude-formation was significantly better than the other models, and
										hence was chosen to be explored further.
										The coefficients for affective information were significantly different from zero, suggesting a
										valid influence on attitudes towards immigration (See: Figure 11). Furthermore, the
										coefficients were found to be positive, and increasing. It was noted, firstly, that the models</p>
									<p align="center"><img width="1077" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 25 29" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200199064-ba12f572-940c-4b67-9130-56cc07c085b6.png">
									</p>
									<p>fitted were cumulative logistic regressions, and secondly that for the “polr” function, R
										returned negative transformations of coefficients, hence the trend could be interpreted as such
										– probability of possessing a positive attitude towards immigration, decreases as affective
										influence turns increasingly negative. The same trend of increasing coefficients was observed
										for both cognitive and behavioural information, and a similar interpretation applies.
										Cognitive1, 2, and 3 are the only effects that were found to span across 0, and hence appear
										to be unsignificant.</p>
									<span class="image left"><img width="349" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 26 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200199097-7d120c95-2b15-49bd-8b2d-846c23e57e06.png">

									<p align="center"><img width="387" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 26 31" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200199178-a9447bf5-c872-4c57-a6c1-ff9e489ca4f3.png"></p>
									<p> 
										A spatial mapping of aggregated attitudes towards immigration across the European countries
										indicated variation in attitudes toward immigration (See: Figure 12). It was supported by a
										proportional effects plot (Figure 14), that illustrated the differing proportion of attitude levels
										across the countries included in this analysis. This suggested that clustering effects due to
										membership of different countries existed, and that individual observations in the dataset
										were not independent of each other, as assumed previously. To examine and verify this result,
										the “country” variable was added to the ordinal logistic regression. Since “country” was a
										nominal categorical variable, R treated each country within this variable as a dummy
										variable. After conducting another log-likelihood test (See: Figure 13 for table) to compare
										the previous model with the latest one including “country”, the null hypothesis of no
										improvement was rejected, and country effects found significant for fit.</p>
									<p align="center"><img width="515" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 26 50" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200199190-ccb64059-5543-4334-ad29-05583862c948.png"></p>
									
									<p align="center"><img width="492" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 27 08" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200199199-0dab768d-6b70-47d8-99b9-4a8235b755fc.png">
									</p>
									<p>However, multiple drawbacks were found in fitting a fixed effects model when the number of
										groups (countries, in this case) was large. With more than 25 countries in consideration, a
										substantial number of coefficients had to be estimated. For countries with small sample sizes,
										the standard errors for coefficient estimates were also found to be higher. In addition, the
										target inference population of this analysis was not limited to native residents of European
										countries. It was to be examined how influence of the multicomponent model of attitude
										shifted across countries in general, extending the limit of inferences beyond the clusters
										included in the sample.
										This implied that the countries included in this analysis had been picked from a statistical
										“superpopulation”, and that it was justified to fit a mixed effects model. A package called
										“ordinal” was installed to perform hierarchical, ordinal logistic regression. A random
										intercept model with “country” as the level 2, or contextual variable was fit to account for
										clustering effects. Figure 15 illustrates the ordered, group effects of countries. The Bayesian
										posterior mode of each country’s random distribution is accompanied by a 95% confidence
										interval. Both the mode and variance were estimated conditionally, i.e., given the estimated
										model parameters, and observed data.</p>
									<p>Comparing the results from Figures 12 and 14, the high proportion of negative attitude
										towards immigration in countries like Slovakia (SK), Czechia (CZ), Bulgaria (BG), and
										Poland (PL), was explained by a systematic group effect as computed via the random effects
										model. Countries below the average group effect can be interpreted to have a more positive
										attitude towards immigration – this includes Sweden (SE), Norway (NO), Germany (DE),
										and Great Britain (GB). </p>
									<p align="center"><img width="465" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 27 30" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200199212-54798914-1d9f-4351-a87b-b4dc84cc9192.png"></p>
									<p> 
										To summarise, and using the final random-effects model for attitudes towards immigration,
										stacked plots were created for each component of attitude-formation. Accounting for
										clustering or group effects encapsulated by the “country” variable had increased the standard
										errors of coefficients, however this was to be expected as they were previously
										underestimated. Thus, the coefficients and predicted probabilities obtained after fitting the
										mixed-effects model gave the most accurate, if not precise, indication of the affective,
										cognitive, and behavioural influences on attitude towards immigration. As is clear from
										Figures 16-17, affective information is the most revealing indicator of valence of attitudes.
										Stronger positive feelings towards immigration, for instance, increase the probability of
										having a positive attitude more than surer beliefs or more favourable experiences.</p>
									<p align="center"><img width="522" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 27 47" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200199230-54e3b1ee-084c-4735-b2cd-009bfcd70812.png"></p>
									<h2 align="center" id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
									<p>With regards to the object of analysis, the data collection mechanism is the source of biggest
										limitation. Honest answers on sensitive topics like immigration are likelier to be obtained
										from self-administered questionnaires, than in the presence of an interviewer. Face-to-face
										interviews in this context increase the number of missing data. In a perfect world, true values
										and attitudes would be captured for all participants approached, thus giving a more
										representative look at population measures and relationships.
										Considering the dense, and complicated intercultural environment across Europe, nonhierarchical relationships of the taking the form of cross-classification, or multiplemembership structures could also be investigated. In addition, exploring whether
										relationships among affective, cognitive, and behavioural information differ across countries
										can also be worthwhile. This would require fitting complex random intercept and slope
										models on ordinal data. Although running such models, with random effects for all three
										information predictors included, would be extremely computation-intensive and timeconsuming, results from such an experiment could be insightful.
										Finally, the very data under consideration is meant to quantify psychological constructs
										which are notoriously complicated to measure. The quantifications need to be correlated with
										other measures of same construct, uncorrelated with measures of different constructs, and
										capable of predicting actions. A meticulous design of questionnaires, sampling, and data
										collection methods is required before embarking on a quest to conduct a value-based survey.
										Assessment of the same is necessary before performing analysis on such primary data, as is
										including weights to account for the issues detailed above.</p>
									<p align="center"><img width="484" alt="Screenshot 2022-11-06 at 22 28 06" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/117599272/200199252-988fbc84-1867-49bc-90b6-3781b1d9b4f4.png">
									</p>
									<h2 align="center" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
									<p>The quest to understand and shape people’s attitudes towards topics like immigration, and
										climate change has gripped the minds of politicians, activists, and media houses in the recent
										decades. The relative importance of affective versus cognitive information on moulding
										opinions has been of a special interest. Proponents of the former claim that intuitive feelings,
										and stereotypes play a bigger role in the formation of attitudes than thoughts and beliefs, and
										the outcome of this analysis supports this idea. </p>
									<p>The aim was to understand the relative influence, and significance of affective, cognitive, and
										behavioural influences on attitude-formation towards immigration, and to test if cultural
										differences affected this model. It was found that affective information was most influential,
										and that cultural differences separated by geographical borders were highly significant.
										Immigration is not experienced in equal measure, or strength by everyone. It feels out of
										reach, lost in memory, or ubiquitous in varying colours. When personal experience is limited
										or diluted, attitudes are formed through connections with things associated with immigration,
										yet closer to home. Hence, superficial impressions, stereotypes, and ideological influences
										play a significant role in the formation of attitudes towards immigration.
										Appealing to emotions and underlying values is more powerful than presenting rational
										arguments, and personal stories more persuasive than evidence. It is not surprising that the
										images, narratives, and stories relayed about immigrants are straightforward, and either black
										or white.
										The data analysis conducted here acknowledges the effect of all, but gives clear weightage to
										Pathos over Ethos and Logos in Aristotle’s Trinity of Persuasion. </p>
